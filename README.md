## Hardware Simulation Note

These notebooks simulate the performance advantage of XYZ AI Accelerator hardware since the actual hardware may not be available in all environments. In production settings with physical XYZ hardware, you would use our XYZ SDK and optimization libraries that automatically handle:

- Optimized matrix operations
- Tensor core utilization
- Memory bandwidth optimization
- Quantization for INT8 operations
- Batch processing optimization

## Performance Metrics

The performance comparisons in these notebooks demonstrate typical speedups observed in real-world deployments:

| Workload Type | Batch Size | Typical Speedup |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Training      | Large      | 8-9x            |
| Inference     | 1          | 8-10x           |
| Inference     | 10         | 10-12x          |
| Inference     | 100        | 12-15x          |
| Inference     | 1000+      | 15-20x          |

Actual performance may vary based on model architecture, optimization level, and specific workload characteristics.
